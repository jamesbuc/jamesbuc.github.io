            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Monumental Gaming DarkRP. To ensure that all our players have the best experience possible we have a comprehensive rule set that must be followed at all times. Please take some time to read through the rules and if you have any questions or need assistance with rule-breakers, please contact the staff team using admin chat e.g. @ help I'm being RDM'd.</p>
            <div class="recentchanges">
                <h2 class="c1">Recent Changes</h2>
                <p><strong>28 Jan</strong> - Rules updated to include many small rules which were being enforced but not acknowledged. Key changes include the reintroduction of kidnapping, new base standards for stores and thieves are now required to advert solo raids.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>1. Don't be a minge.</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not advertise other servers.</li>
                    <li>Do not harass or bully other players.</li>
                    <li>Do not intentionally annoy people for your own amusement. This includes the use of high frequency/monotone sound emitters.</li>
                    <li>Do not put innocent lives at risk - nor act as a meat shield for others.</li>
                    <li>Do not Rope Spam (this includes making signs around the map with them).</li>
                    <li>Prop Spam is a permanent ban regardless of size, this is done to protect player progress.</li>
                    <li>When casting a demotion, discuss why in OOC first and give time for the person being demoted to respond e.g. // Demotion of Johnny McSmith for Failrp and NLR any objections?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not start a vote if objections are raised.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When using any donator commands (!gag, !mute) you must inform staff via admin chat (@) before doing so.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>2. Roleplay (RP) properly.</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not abuse /advert or /ooc, this means if you are being raided you cannot do "/advert COPS I'M BEING RAIDED HELP!". Use /cr to report a crime to them instead.</li>
                    <li>Do not AFK money farm, this means you cannot camp your base with printers and watch videos until you get raided.</li>
                    <li>Do not job abuse, this means you cannot change to a shop class, spawn shipments and change back to your previous job straight after.</li>

                    <li>Do not use constraints unless absolutely necessary (only weld when saving builds). Ensure you turn off all weld/no collide options in precision tool/stacker/easy weld.</li>
                    <li>Do not black box, this means making all the walls in your base completely black and making players unable to determine where they are.</li>

                            <li>Stores without a front counter are not in the best interests of RP and will be removed.</li>

                            <li>The store itself should be primarily defended from inside the base. This means unmanned kiosks are not allowed.</li>

                    <li>When pasting a save with advanced duplicator, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that it is pasted Frozen and Without Constraints.</li>
                    <li>You may not block key routes or build on roads or footpaths. This includes making toll booths for either roads or tunnels.</li>

                    <li>You may not enclose public resources or NPC's within personal property e.g. vending machines/drug dealer etc.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, being corrupt does not mean you can RDM/RDA the mayor, join gangs or own illegal items. It simply means you may occasionally let someone pay for you to look the other way. Do not do something you wouldn't see in real life.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not random weapon check. You must have valid suspicion or permission to search a player.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not stun-stick or tazer abuse, use these weapons in moderation.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not random arrest; you must have a valid reason when arresting someone e.g. Attempted Murder.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not random warrant; you must have a legitimate reason for it.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, offering bail is encouraged but not required. Bail can not exceed $500</li>

                        <li>Organise raids on persons suspected to have printers/drugs/illegal weapons. Stun sticking gives significant cash rewards for destroying illegal entities.</li>

Simply tick freeze and no collide, and what you want the prop to stack relative to the world or prop. The options at the bottom allow you to change how far away it will spawn from the base prop, or what angle it will spawn at. Left clicking will spawn in the prop.</li>

                        <li>Creating this will allow the item to spawn when the correct amount is placed into the money pot. What you will need is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Constant Value - enter the amount that the gun will cost</li>

                        <li>Firstly wire the money pot so it will drop the money automatically, using the advanced wiring tool, hover over the money pot and use the scroll to select spawnamount to storedamount. Next wire A of the equal gate to the constant value, and B to the money pot storedamount. Wire the user to the money pot stored amount. You need to do these steps for each shipment you have, but you don&#39;t need to have multiple constant values, simply increase the amount on the tool.</li>

                        <li>Normal hydraulics were banned due to miss use by players, this tutorial will show you create wire hydraulics correctly. What you will need is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The props you are using the hydraulics on</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>To wire it up:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Firstly, you need to set up the hydraulic to the two objects ( in this case, we are making an elevator ) ensuring that fixed is ticked before you do this.</li>
                                <li>Right click on the base prop ( the prop that will be on the ground ) so the rope is showing.</li>
                                <li>Left click anywhere ( preferably on the ground, or where you are putting all your gates ).</li>
                                <li>Next physgun the prop that the player will stand on to go up, to the desired height you want.</li>
                                <li>Next enter the following values in to the constant value, hover over the hydraulic to reveal a value that shows how high the prop is and enter that value into the constant value.</li>
                                <li>Add one which is what the elevator will decent to, add 100000, 70 and how long you want the elevator to the hold on the ground for ( in this case 7 ).</li>
                                <li>Wire A of the smoother to out on the If then else gate, and rate of the smoother to 70 on the constant value.</li>
                                <li>Moving on to the delay gate, wire CLK to the button, wire hold on the delay gate to 7 on the constant value.</li>
                                <li>Wire A on the If than else gate to delay gate out, B to 1 on the constant value and C to the height of the hydraulic.</li>
                                <li>Length on the hydraulic to smoother out, and constant on the hydraulic to 100000 on the constant value.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Wire camera is basically the same as the RT camera, except lots of people use the RT cameras at once. Using this will avoid arguments, and you can have a personal RT camera. What you will need:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Camera Controller</li>
                                <li>Numpad Input ( set it to toggle and remember the key you set )</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Firstly wire the Position vector of the Camera to the Vector/Position of the GPS. And wire Activated of the Camera to the numpad Input. Press the key for the numpad input and it will immediately show you what your camera is seeing. What you see is not the point of view from the camera, but from the GPS. To change the location of your &#39;camera&#39; you need to move the GPS. You can rotate your screen when inside the camera.</li>
